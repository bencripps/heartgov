# Heart Gov

## What's HeartGov?

###### HeartGov was designed with one idea in mind: make it easier for people, community organizations, and government to connect to each other. HeartGov is a text message based platform designed to better connect and create a two-way communication between local government, community based organizations, and residents. HeartGov provides the space for conversation and collaboration between communities and government on a platform while crossing the digital divide between web and mobile technology.
